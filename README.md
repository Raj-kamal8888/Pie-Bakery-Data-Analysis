# Pie-Bakery-Data-Analysis
**About the Project:**
Pie Bakery specializes in selling a variety of delicious pies. The goal of this project was to analyze the bakery's revenue for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, and identify the best-selling pie and the most popular pie type.
**Process Involved:**
I imported Excel files into Power BI using Power Query Editor.
Extensive data cleaning and transformation were performed to ensure accurate insights.
DAX measures, columns, and parameters were created to enhance the analysis.
An interactive dashboard was designed to present the insights in a visually appealing manner.
**Insights**:
The revenue generated from Apple Pie was the highest among all pies, making it the best-selling product.
March and April consistently had higher revenue in all three years.
Whole pies were more popular than individual slices, contributing to higher overall revenue.
Interestingly, pre-orders resulted in more revenue compared to in-store orders, except in 2020 when both types of orders generated equal revenue.
Consumers showed a preference for Organic Pie over Non-Organic Pie, as the former had higher revenue.
